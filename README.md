Whack-A-mole game for 2 players based on Atmel Assembler

The game depends on the circuit seen in circuit.png. Turned out it's not good readable. I promise to add a CAD version.

The build.sh file depends on the compiler avra, avrdude and an STK500. Any other way to push the code to the Chip will do. 

Chip needs to be configured to 2 MHz.
